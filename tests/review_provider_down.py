"""A reviewer-provider outage backs the loop off; it is not charged to whichever PR was next.

TauCetiReview#117 gave the engine a distinct exit status for "I stopped because the provider is
unusable, and I posted nothing": a revoked credential, or an exhausted subscription window. Before
that the engine exited 0 having posted a scoreboard of `error` rows, so do_review took the success
path. With a real non-zero status it would otherwise fall into the ordinary failure branch and
charge `review-err-<pr>` — a per-PR, lifetime counter that only a posted review resets. Three of
them drop the PR from review candidacy (survey) and open a public "Review stuck: PR #N" issue, so an
outage lasting one quota window could strand several unrelated PRs. Review workers run
`--ignore-quota` precisely so they do not pace, which is what makes that a live risk rather than a
theoretical one.

This is the same carve-out the TauCetiData publish failure and the host-binary preflight already
make, in the same words: machine-wide, so warn loudly and raise NoProgress rather than bump a
per-PR counter.

Pinned here:

  1. The provider-down status raises NoProgress, charges nothing, and records no per-PR failure.
  2. An ordinary engine failure is unchanged: charged, recorded, returned.
  3. A successful review is unchanged: the counter is cleared.
  4. classify_failure calls an exhausted plan `provider-unavailable`, so the public stuck-issue text
     says the provider was unavailable rather than "review command failed".

Exit 0 = all assertions hold; 1 = a mismatch.
